3Coffee Game
=======
This is a small game I created in college on top of an open source Java Game Engine - https://github.com/divs1210/3Coffee
It helped me understand the basics of Game development, along with multithreading programming in Java.

Instructions:
To run the game without compiling, just run "AnasGame.jar". Ensure that the folder "media" is in the same directory as the jar file.

Source Code:
Check the folder "src/gameanas"

Disclaimer:
3Coffee is not a professional game engine, and neither is it optimized.
And though it is very possible to create production-quality games, a more skilled developer would
probably be better off with a nicer engine.
